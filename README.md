===================

All kinds of ObjC helper classes. The name of the repository - was amazingly suggested by GitHub :-)

## Me
* Hi! I am Daniel Cohen Gindi. Or in short- Daniel.
* danielgindi@gmail.com is my email address.
* That's all you need to know.

## Compilation
* Everything should compile with no dependencies on other libraries. Specific iOS frameworks may be required, so just listen to your compiler.
* Everything is ARC based. As we are moving forward to a world where iOS 5.x is deprecated - things will soon be iOS 6.x based. 
* I have no intent to keep backwards compatibility for platforms which are used by less than 1.5% of the population.

## License

I'm not a lawyer, and have no understanding of all of those open-source licenses.
Anyone is welcome to use my code, with the following limitations only:
* You may not re-publish the code here under another name or author.
* You are asked politely to give credits to the author (Daniel Cohen Gindi) - but do not absolutely have to. :-)
