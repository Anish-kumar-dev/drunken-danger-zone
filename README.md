## Me
* Hi! I am Daniel Cohen Gindi. Or in short- Daniel.
* danielgindi@gmail.com is my email address.
* That's all you need to know.

## Compilation
* Everything should compile with no dependencies on other libraries. Specific iOS frameworks may be required, so just listen to your compiler. *You can take any single library here without the rest - they are all independent.*
* Everything is ARC based. As we are moving forward to a world where iOS 5.x is deprecated - things will soon be iOS 6.x based. 
* I have no intent to keep backwards compatibility for platforms which are used by less than 1.5% of the population.
