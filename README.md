===================

All kinds of ObjC helper classes. The name of the repository - was amazingly suggested by GitHub :-)

## Moved libraries:

I'm starting to move libraries from this repository to separate repositories, and will update here with the relevant urls.

* `DGSlideMenuViewController` was renamed to `DGSlideViewController`, refactored, and moved to https://github.com/danielgindi/DGSlideViewController/
* `DGBarcodeView` was moved to https://github.com/danielgindi/DGBarcodeView
* `DGBorderedLabel` was moved to https://github.com/danielgindi/DGBorderedLabel

## Me
* Hi! I am Daniel Cohen Gindi. Or in short- Daniel.
* danielgindi@gmail.com is my email address.
* That's all you need to know.

## Compilation
* Everything should compile with no dependencies on other libraries. Specific iOS frameworks may be required, so just listen to your compiler. *You can take any single library here without the rest - they are all independent.*
* Everything is ARC based. As we are moving forward to a world where iOS 5.x is deprecated - things will soon be iOS 6.x based. 
* I have no intent to keep backwards compatibility for platforms which are used by less than 1.5% of the population.
